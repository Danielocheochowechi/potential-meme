                    <h2>Hello</h2>
                    <p> My name is Daniel Oche Ochowechi, I am a Web Developer. Well as for me wed developing was what i have ever taught of doing and the finance wasen't there, And i needed a change in my life. I felt life hadn't treated me fairly and was quite frustrated. One day while In school, I was having a discussin with my friends just talking then one of my friends just said he wanted to be a computer programmer so i just picked up a challange in that and when i went home i told my parents that i wanted to be a computer programmer and thay told me that they didnt have the fund to sponsor me so then they told me one of our neighbours was a computer programmer and if i could meet him he would be of good help to me in my programming cerrier.
                        Then i meet him, explained every thing to him and that it all started. 
                        On a very special i was making a a research when i came across<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp</a>. What really caught my eye were the numerous opportunities becoming a programmer could afford me. I instantly decided within myself that this is what I wanted to do. That's how the journey started and I'm still on the road.</p>
